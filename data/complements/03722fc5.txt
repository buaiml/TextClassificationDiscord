Sorry that I can't give you the female perspective, but human are beings are so diverse anyway, there will always be people who find you attractive and people who don't, no matter what you look like, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all that.. so just focus on self-love and acceptance for what you are, you seem like a good dude :)
