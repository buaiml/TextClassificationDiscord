I'm not a doctor but does your dysmorphia is the kind that makes you "abnormally beautiful"?, Cuz dear God n.n, you look amazing, your eyes, your cute freckles and your hair, how I wish I could braid it 😍, plus your lips make that smile of you get over the top, I feel like smiling just looking at you ☺️☺️☺️, o know sometimes life is hard, but keep smiling and life's gonna want to smile back at you 😍...
