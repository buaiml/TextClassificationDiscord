If you see someone and just feel the urge to compliment them, I think it would be pretty normal to just say "Excuse me, sorry to stop you, I just really like your style/hairdo/tattoo" (I'm focusing on physical qualities because stopping someone you don't know to compliment them on their personality might be a little weird... P.S.
