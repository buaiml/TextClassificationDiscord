I know seems can be hard when working with stone and glass so I think if you found a thin wire braided like this one: Then glued it on with the right kind of glue (something that dries clear and adheres to stone glass and metal, plenty of options) then it would put the finishing touch on it :-) That's very sweet, and make sure you tell her the story of finding it and thinking of her, etc.
