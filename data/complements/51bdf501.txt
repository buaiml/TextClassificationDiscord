I always think about going out and doing something balls to the wall crazy awesome like that, but always find I have something much more mundane that makes me unable to, like getting my ass through college and having a negative bank balance because of it, so congrats dude, super jealous you're doing all the cool shit I wish I could go do, and you should be very impressed with yourself!
