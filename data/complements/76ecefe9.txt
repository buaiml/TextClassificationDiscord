You're an unfilmable book You're a Bond villain You're pipes leaking liquid through an ancient painted ceiling You're *nevery*one, *nevery*where You're the gulf between toothed, plastic clips and windswept hair You're downloaded panoramas of some far-flung fractal summit The Benthic depths into which gasp-hungry whales plummet What I'm trying to say here is - YOU'RE as asset You're a sabotaged political spectacle You're nuns' and vicars' gropings under cassocks in a vestibule You're our disregard for border guards While we hurl animated instruments towards the stars You're the microinstant between a pendulum's back, and forth The infrasonic source we move away from, and towards And you're legitimate, spitting rage You're kids' crucial fingers freeing birds from their owner's cage You're former promise You're mountains engorged with jungle, *blue* with distance You're omni-hued hurled paint's chaos-ordained mission You're a dog's thrill at the hunt, and the blood in it's mouth YOU'RE what counts You're a Star Baby You're *so* cool, you're *so* cool, you're *so* cool You're guys propped up in bars brandishing custom-made pool cues You're the roaring magma below, nacreous clouds colliding above You are radially-symmetrical deposits of LUV You're bells struck in rebellion, and the beauty of their pealing You're skies purpled by collapsing evenings You're Capricornian *ultra*-temperatures You're the yawning void preceding number and measure You're all the objects of all our poets' figuratively haemorrhaging hearts You're this magnificent, shuddering *Something* suffusing us with love Love!
