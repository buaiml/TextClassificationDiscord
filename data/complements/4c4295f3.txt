hey, i hope you're doin okay stranger, you're going through a shitty time but the fact that you're so worried about your dogs and your family shows that you're a kind hearted person, i feel like youll be ok in the long run, 16 is basically still a baby, just keep your head down, focus on your study and try for jobs at places like a book store where theyre more likely to accept actual resumes.
