My recommendation is to take another picture with the camera in a low position kind like the one you posted featuring a big smile, a natural sky background, and maybe something grandiose behind you like a statue of a dude on a horse or a big mountain range, and if you have no such thing, you could hold up something you love, a food, for example.
