Be passionate, do what makes you happy, and you'll attract the right people Dating sucks for sure, just started again after a 2 1/2 relationship and rejecting my girlfriend's marriage proposal If life were easy, it wouldn't be as fun Get out there and let people see your physical beauty and the makeup/content of your character You'll be better than OK :)
