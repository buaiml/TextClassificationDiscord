You are so strong, and I'm so happy that you are still here :) I think I'm stepping forward but my world moves in reverse Everyone else is doing fine as though their lives have been rehearsed But if I look between the lines I know that I'll be fine Because while others might feel stuck I know that right now is my time Though I'm living in my car, at least I am not tethered down A new chapter is beginning even if it's from the ground I'll step out in the Sun and feel its warmth caress my skin And let the numbness pass to find that my strength comes from within That I am not a coward nor a wimp for what I did I'm stronger than I think because I am on my second wind My faith has been depleting but here again I stand Knowing that my worth is not discovered in a man So here I take it one day at a time, knowing that my future's there And if I look a little deeper I'll see that people care Because I'm worth it, I deserve it, I will fight for what is mine My life is special, priceless even, Yes, I know that I'll be fine.
