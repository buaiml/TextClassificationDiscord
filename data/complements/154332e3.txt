Whatchu talking about, I mean look at those eyes, the green is so strong and clear, it is so easy to look at and so captivating even, and oh my god your hair, don't even get me started, too bad I am getting started, it's lovely, it's this wonderful combination of blonde and brown, it's clear you put a lot of care into what others think about you, and how you can improve as a person, and while in extreme amounts it can be straining on a person's well-being, I do believe if you keep it at a healthy pace, it's a wonderful trait to have that's incredibly difficult to teach someone if they don't know how to do it on their own, confidence should come from self reliance and self reflection if you want to build long lasting confidence to hold on to, now, let my words in a sense be a stepping stone for you, I do truly mean everything I say, oh and I forgot to mention, you have a nice smile and not everyone can rock piercings as well as you do, so good on you, keep up the great work, keep moving forward, I know you can do it, best of wishes!!!
