are well-intentioned, but the truth is that the only reason you feel self-conscious or embarrassed is because you don't fit the traditional model of beauty, and trying to convince you based on all of your flattering features is only reinforcing the idea that you have to meet some kind of standard of attractiveness or else you're right to look down on yourself, and that's absolute bullshit.
