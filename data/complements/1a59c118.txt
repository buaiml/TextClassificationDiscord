The beauty of that smile Though Ã¥ sadness in the eye Be proud, gorgeous you I'd be proud to call you one of my crew That smile is fantastic I bet you're bombastic You can call me a friend I'll always have a ear to lend I hope your day is getting better There is a person out there who is thinking "go and get her!"
