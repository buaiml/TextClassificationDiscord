Don't let the insults get you down, focus on those positive comments and how you're happy about what you're doing, most of the negative stuff are just people with narrow world views trying to police your happiness, but you seem to be a person with a lot of courage, and if you know what makes you happy and it isn't hurting anyone nobody should be trying to discourage it.
