I know self care for men can be hard to find, so here's some ideas: meditate with your favorite incense or candle, write out all your feelings in a journal or email, go find a place that offers a hot towel treatment and get a haircut for that boost of confidence, take a nap, take a hot/long ass shower, go hiking, go lift some weights at the gym, binge watch that shitty cartoon/drama you've seen and thought about watching, or draw out your feelings.
