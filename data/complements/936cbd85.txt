QUIT YOUR JOB has been for me A kind of mantra since university You've freed your mind, and your body Now you've quit your favourite hobby I have so much love for you, Curly Sue, diva boots in butchers' eyes Blue, hair red perhaps, or cosmos black The endless night where the stars are stacked Diva dance with us here, the end of Fall Together, orbiting a decaying fireball Worlds of birth, swinging from our roots Our angels and demons in cahoots But Diva identifies her demons It's okay that she tried to feed them Freedom now, cosmic hair frames her Brow, browbeaten but never cowed: I bow To you, Bonnie Blue Creation, rendered, emerges from you - - - - - - - I believe in you, as sure as we're nearing December.
