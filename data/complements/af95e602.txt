The way your hair compliments your skin tone and eye color and omg your choice in make up is spectacular too because it really does match everything about you, it doesn't mask anything, it just makes the best parts of you shine brighter and that's the best way to use makeup honestly, you did an absolutely amazing job that I couldn't even dream of achieving tbh, and I love your outfit btw, I'm low-key jealous of it, but idk if I'd be able to pull of the beauty you get from it as well as you do, it's just so colorful and lovely 😍🤩, keep up the fantastic work!!
