I see the arch an expression in your brow and the way it so perfeclty matches the story I see in your smile which to me is saying "nice try life, you can try to bring me down, but you cant cause I know my worth and im fucking fighting for me" I dont see mental illness when I see this I just see a brave beautiful woman fighting for her place in this dumb world and looking bad ass while doing it, and thats just what I see in your face, don't even get me started on how absolutely stunning and powerful I think your hair looks.
