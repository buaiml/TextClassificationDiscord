When you wake up in the morning hope your day is great And that dealing with your hangover is a piece of cake Drinking on a school night really ain't so bad Brings me back to the "best years I ever had" &amp;#x200B; You're like Harley Quinn but with the curly hair And an inviting smile that can get you anywhere You seem like the type of girl who speaks with her style And is still in touch with who she was as a child &amp;#x200B; Depression is a demon to fight from dusk til dawn Hold on to the hope that someday it will be gone Until then if you've got to drink whiskey or beer It can make the mind run a little bit clearer &amp;#x200B; Don't forget to hit the books like a boxing bag And appreciate those days when things are not so bad If those days are few and far between I hope the mirror holds the beauty I am seeing
