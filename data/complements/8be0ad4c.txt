Every day I hurt, not only because of my own battle that I'v been fighting for a few years but because of all the hurt all innocent people are suffering through, I know I shouldn't watch the news because its negative and depressing but every time you turn it on something terrible and tragic is going on, The situation in Paris is breaking my heart the situation with the police and minorities is breaking my heart, all around intolerance, ignorance, hate, racism, it literally makes my heart hurt..
