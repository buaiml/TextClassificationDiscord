I use: kose softymo speedy cleansing oil kojie san soap (this brightens your skin and gets rid of scaring it's awesome) Toner- I honestly have the best luck with either Apple cider vinegar or witch hazel tony moly snail gel- it's made from snail mucin and I know it weird but trust me it works And whatever moisturizer you use, I use Aveeno because my face is slightly on the oily side.
