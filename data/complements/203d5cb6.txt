I know you don't feel it now, but one day you'll be so grateful you were freed from that 'man'- you deserve so much better, stay strong, hold on &amp; things will improve &lt;3 Remember, the only constant in life is change, change is coming- &amp; everything is going to be ok - it really is =) So hold your beautiful head up high, &amp; fake it till you make it =)
