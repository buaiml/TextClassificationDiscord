I hope that the worst part of the year is behind you, I hope that great things will start happening from now on, I hope you find millions of reasons to smile, but if you don't, if everything seems to be going the same way I hope yo remember to take a deep breath and keep going, hopefully one day you will look back and see that a big change for the better took place.
