Mad propz for being able to work that much this week and still dress/cleanup/whatevs to look that good--- some weeks (or months) i'm lucky if i get around to shaving or haircuts haha In all seriousness, you already have a solid work ethic and foundation for success- having that experience and balancing with school will go a long way.
