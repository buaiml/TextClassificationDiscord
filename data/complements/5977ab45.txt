It is a little known fact that the Spam Filter actually does its best to catch pictures of people with: 1) Really nice hair 2) Rocking Beard Stubble 3) A sense of self worth that, while wobbly at times, is perfectly capable of carrying oneself through those hard times, secure in the knowledge that there are good and kind people out there with which you will share those good times.
