Please know that you are absolutely beautiful just as you are, and I hope that no one (partner, employer, modeling agency, etc) ever makes you feel that you "would be so much prettier if you changed..." The color of your hair is beautiful, and natural hair color has amazing highlights all by itself, so if anyone says you should go blonde please tell them to shove it!
