I saw your other post, over at "compliment me please"- And as I read it I let out an audible "please" You say you don't feel pretty, and for that I think your crazy- It's so clear to us all that your a beautiful lady, Your friends might all have boyfriends, while your still stuck alone- But life is not a race, be patient you will grow, It's guaranteed one day your meet, somebody who will love you- And he'll look at you with glee and put nobody else above you.
