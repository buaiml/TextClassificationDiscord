I'm also very confused what kind of people you must be finding to make you dislike even a part of yourself, because not only is your natural beauty a pretty great start by itself, your smile (smiles are nice, world needs more smiles :) ) and the style you seem to be rockin' complement it wonderfully, though the latter two on their own with even a quarter the effort put in would still be worth feeling very proud of.
