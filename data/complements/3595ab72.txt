Also do not feel singled out by people like that, there's genuine people like me out there that adore all reptiles i love lizards too...i love aligator eyes, chameleons, all sneks.....all of em.. all of these animals are mesmerizingly beautiful once you encounter them face to face.....unless its in the wild :p
