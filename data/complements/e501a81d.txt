Listen to my voice and remember my words: Never fight alone A soul that shines so bright Like a reflection from heaven In a dark world shines a light Glorified in you You have strength You are love You have compassion And you have mercy You have wisdom You are ambitious You have life And you are worthy You're a lady You're a lion You are honest And you're important You are holy And when you speak Your words will shake The foundations of this earth
