Compliments that I've recieved that have really meant something to me are stuff like, you're funny, you don't give up, you're good at solving problems, you care a lot about others, "you have a strong moral compass", you have good ideas, you're patient, you're wise, you're dedicated, you're fearless, you have a warm personality, I like spending time with you, you have a cool style (lots of PPs mentioned this one) I feel like would honestly feel a bit hurt if a stranger commented on my appearance.
