Low Communication Is a relation of High Cunning You protect yourself From running into situations With strange souls, and Collecting cold stories, both brittle And bold You do this since you're The warmth that sings Of those iridescent physical laws That give lift to birds' wings You're the days ahead of me The wisdom within melody You're the space between Electrons, between stars Art we reflect on But space is not empty Space is Time It is *potency* And if you'll give it a little Reflection You'll see this space you are is really Connection - - - - - - - - Take care of your mind and your soul; find the others, realise your true role.
