Well buddy I am almost drawn to Study that fearsome beard That is the kind of beard Which generates fear Amongst the citizens The denizens of this strange world Unfurled and perturbed for one Such as you, some kind of god Lashed to dolphins, leading Their pod across wild seas A rushing mane, bent at the horizon And in the distance, flames See there are worlds for you to tame Warriors to best and women to Carry to bed To bring into the warm, far from these Unruly waves and their blue storm You smell that?
