That's rain That's rage, let it douse your pain Again you are, and again Some kind of wild god No beginning, no end, and after all You are enough, you are stellar stuff, nothing requiring your defence The universe inside you, immense, Makes beggars of us all When you build your next reality Give us all a role, a scene, However small - - - - - - You're fuckin rock and roll dude, don't let yourself entertain nothing different.
