Hey dude i know exactly what you are going through and i've definately been there.all your problems are linked to each other and solving at least one of them will make it ten times easier to solve the rest.go out.just try to talk to people.wear something that can start up a conversation to make it easier.make friends and then things will start to change.this is what i did and im pretty sure it will work for you too.with that handsome face it wont be difficult to get a girlfriend so dont worry about that.if u improve all of these ur grades will improve automatically so dont worry.have faith in yourself, i know you can do it.üòÅ
