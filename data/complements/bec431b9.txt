Actually, a YAAASSSS... Also... - Your tattoo choice makes you seem in touch with yourself, but I can tell by the definition in your arms that you’re not one to mess with - You have great taste in shades - Despite not being able to see your eyes, you seem like you’re fine af and if you came up to me and struck up a conversation, I probably wouldn’t brush you off (cause you’re on Reddit, so I’ll assume that you’re a relatively good conversationalist) Don’t let depression get you down, love.
