Best of luck to you, I know it's difficult to go someplace new, even just getting a new job was hard for me when moving wasn't involved, leaving behind people you know can be tough but at the same time it's exciting to think about the kinds of people you might meet, people with similar interests, your new best friend could be there waiting for you now!
