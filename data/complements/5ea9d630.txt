I'm loving the swimsuit, it totally matches your style, I would be jealous of it but honestly I could never *dream* of pulling it off as well as you do, for real you look spectacular in it especially the way it compliments your hair and eyes, and your catttt aaaa they look so cute make sure to give them cuddles for me ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º, overall hopefully it didn't damage your phone too much, and I hope you're able to swim better in the future (also I know it's stupid but even your swimsuit and phone case match ðŸ¤©) you're killing it, keep it up, rooting for you !!!
