You are stylish (piercings plus purple hair dye plus denim jacket along with makeup are just on point) and are fairly gorgeous and I feel you have a creative side to you (studied graphic design in college once upon a time and I get the vibe from you that I got from my classmates) which is plain awesome overall.
