You can wash your face with plain water then apply coconut oil with some drops of lavender essential oil before going out so that you don't smell like vinegar (it's faint after it dries, but still an occasional scent here and there) Those three things will give you skin that you're friends will be jealous of :-) they're all cheap and can be found at any natural foods type store.
