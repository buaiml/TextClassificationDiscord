ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©, And you truly do have a beautiful smile, and I'm sorry to hear you're having a tough time finding that motivation to losing your job, friends, and intimate partners, as well as a place you truly did call home, all at once in a rapid fire movement, it's absolutely devasting for any individual, the fact that you are looking to improve your mood through other people, and not declining into your own shell of despair is frankly, simply admirable, and impressive, it's a rare thing to see, and it truly does shine true to you, and who you are as a person, and that being, something remarkable and something to be appreciated, unfortunately, you've hit a rough time, and I honestly just hope you're still able to see the delightful spirit you have that others, and myself, see you as, but I understand how that could be difficult to see when you've lost so much that you hold true to be part of you, and to that, I just wish you the best of luck, my sympathies, and most importantly, my appreciation for you who are, keep it up friend.
