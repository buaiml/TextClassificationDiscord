Try to make a gratitude list in your head about why you made these changes and what positive things you've noticed so far and when you start feeling down about tomorrow take a moment to remember why today is an awesome day, then you won't have to worry about tomorrow because that'll take care of itself or as one of my AA buddies used to say, "Today is the tomorrow that we worried about yesterday, and all is well."
