Sponge got a Grill where her kitty gets some thrills Weighs herself in the balance to find her copacetic, and chill Little Kitty got the high life Admonish herself for even contemplating strife This is living, and this is all we can be, Taking steps to absorb moments, and opponents, breathlessly Spongegrill dress herself in grey Colour of a brother got led astray But the fray is real, and its yours The infrasonic source we move away from (and towards) Baby got her life mapped out and planned Not like she need a hero, salvation, Some deviation - some blue-capped strapped white man in a higher station Baby knows her bones Knows that she far from, far from home But home is in her sights Enemies arrayed like motherfucking stalagmites But she *cool* So she thread her way through, yeah She thread her way through And kitty-cat is all eyes and wise and knows which way is true Spongegrill is no frills Sits with her tabby by the windowsill The floor is hard and freezing like some ancient painted cave And the local star still sends her Love in awesome cosmic waves -------------------------- Relive the past, the stone that was cast; but you are the music while the music lasts
