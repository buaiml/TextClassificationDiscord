It can be easy to focus on things we see as imperfections in ourselves, we have to see them every day, but as someone seeing you for the first time, all I see is a beautiful smile on a beautiful person, even with the snapchat filter :P You look so happy both before and after, you should share that smile with as many people as you can, you'll make their day!
