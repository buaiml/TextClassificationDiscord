Your face tells the story every guy has experienced from rolling the dice on "that crazy bitch every other girl hates"; daddy issues, terrible conversation, great sex, too many texts, need for validation, pretending to love all the things her guy loves, hating her bf's friends after a month, possibly stabbing someone in their sleep before, throws shit when angry, persecution complex, and eventual pill problem.
