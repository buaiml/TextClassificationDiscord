One of three things will happen to your future: 1) you get knocked up in the next year and gain the same cottage cheese legs you gave your mother 2) you go to college where you drop out due to "poor grades", but really it's because you spread the clap twice in 4 different frats 3) you graduate college with a degree in getting free drinks at the bar and a coke addiction.
