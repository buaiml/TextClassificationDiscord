Let's start with the guy, let's call him "she said she was 18": - Congratulations on going outside - I'm glad his mom let him cash in his "chore points" to let his sister take him out for the night - That is the face of a man searching through his database for pickup lines - That mirror I installed for you last week was actually a picture of a stock photo image entitled "low life points at screen, smiling to hide crippling depression" - He looks like he's resisting the urge to hover hand since he's not used to talking to anyone above a 3 - If Seth McFarlane started doing live adaptations of his shows, I can't tell if he would be Steve Smith or Meg Griffin - I bet he's gonna kill her and leave a trail of bloody handprints as "clues" and only refer to himself as "Steve" - I bet he's only allowed to use the family Youtube account - I bet he got a boner from checking out the ceiling lamp that looks like a boob - I bet at family reunions he slides his cousins napkins that say "Please just once I won't tell anyone" Next the girl, let's call her "i swear i'm 18": - I bet she fakes orgasms more than she fakes smiles for her dad trying to use the company credit card again - I feel like she fails every class with a female teacher involved - She looks like the type to walk into a sex shop just to be seen walking out of a sex shop - I bet she's as responsible in relationships as she is with her phone (if you can't see it's terribly cracked and probably her fifth) - She looks like she'd suck dick to be an extra on "Zoey 101" - I bet she tried to do that hair color herself, next time do us a favor and drink the bleach instead - She looks like the type of low-key slut to grow up and be that mom who only allows Kidz Bop in the SUV - She looks like the type to be nice to unpopular kids until she finds out they didn't do the homework either - If only she was born 10 years earlier, she could have landed a spot on SNL and fuck up ghostbusters too - I bet she had to use snapchat to write "roast me" because he took all the napkins for the next family reunion
