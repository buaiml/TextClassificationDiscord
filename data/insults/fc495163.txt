Asian person: Something about the one-child policy Woman of any race, body type, or appearance: Pure hate and meanness and resentment with literally no jokes involved in any way Of course, if you point any of this out, dudes start calling you a "white knight" and an "SJW" and talking about PC and safe spaces (while missing the obvious observation that they want this sub to be a safe space for them to say dumb hateful shit without anyone calling them out) I think a lot of the reason this sub sucks sometimes is the timing of its creation.
