You have that kind of stupid smirk that indicates you have bought into all the bullshit rom coms telling you the nerd gets the great job and the girl in the end and you think that is your life's character, but in reality the good looking jock is going to fuck every girl you ever had any fantasy about and you are going to settle into a low level data entry position and marry a 4-5 that you don't really love but hey you are 30 now, it's time to pump out some more kids of average looks and intelligence, maybe you will go to Thailand on holiday one year and have a glimpse of genuine happiness but in the end you will look back and realise that you were never happy and you didn't have a chance to be, I feel bad for you.
