* Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's mom, Stoned throughout pregnancy * Harry Potter and the Chamber of Sexless, Aging Men * Harry Potter and the Prisoner of a "Manager" job that still pays slightly over minimum * Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fired from 7/11 and couldn't move on * Harry Potter and the Order of the (unfortunately tiny) Penis * Harry Potter and the Half-Brother of Dudley Dursley The last two weren't as good so fuck 'em, but I think you get the theme here.
