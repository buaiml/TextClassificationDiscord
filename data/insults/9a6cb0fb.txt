i fear you took this picture to show off what you consider to be your best assets... i feel bad roasting you if that's the case... hey when you become a grown up and your ears look like 2 dried up pussies with scabs falling off and whatever that bullshit on your chest is looks like an ACDC prison tattoo that was getting drilled into your chest by some arian brotherhood member while you got raped by his brother, I want you to think about this while you do your morning run of the neighborhood picking up garbage bins and realize that there was a time in your life when you had a chance not to be a screw up and that you blew it...
