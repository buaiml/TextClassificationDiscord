You look like the kind of guy who would ask to get roasted on Reddit, post a photo you thought would be funny, then when they actually start shitting on you, try to deflect by reacting to every comment pretending like you don't care what people think about you because you're actually so lonely that you had your mom take this photo for you so you could get some human interaction, even if it's just through a community on a website that hates you.
