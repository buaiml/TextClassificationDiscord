But deep down you are a blank slate; you're humorless, have never formulated any opinions or ideas about politics and society on your own, anytime you talk to other people it's a desperate scramble for any shitty movie or meme reference you can scrape from the back of your mind, and someday it's going to slowly dawn on you that you're not a person but a disgusting amalgamation of the valueless shit the dregs of society have pumped out into pop culture and the Internet.
