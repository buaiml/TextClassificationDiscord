You've got the look of a 28 year old man who had some friends in high school and you were the kinda weird one but you were friends but never good friends with them and then you graduated and didn't amount to anything because you were trying to enjoy freedom and do nothing in life except party and do drugs with your friends and slowly realized you fucked up by not doing anything and your slowly trying to turn your life around but it's not working so you just have that face of regret and disappointment but you're still trying to act cool in case any of your friends want to hang out but you won't ask them because you got all emotional on them and don't want to bother them so you go and watch an old tv with your cat
