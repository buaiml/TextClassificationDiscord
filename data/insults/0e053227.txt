Here's a backwards timeline of your attempts to be fashionable, aiming to lure low self-esteems girls into your shitty apartment/bedroom: * Man bun * Big bushy beard (gave up on that one, obvs) * Tattoos (Gave up when realised how much a full sleeve would cost) * Flat cap (viz: Peaky Blinders) * An aborted attempt to learn a martial art, maybe aikido * Flannel, lots of flannel * Wallet chain * Skinny jeans * Learn the guitar (gave up, too hard) I could go on, but I think playing that PS3 in your mom's spare room is punishment enough.
