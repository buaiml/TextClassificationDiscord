A No Drama sign clearly printed up from the campus computer because you probably wouldn't have enough money to both have a working printer and that much red ink, the cheapest dust pan Target sells, and the cheap ass long board make it difficult to tell if the apartment belongs to you or whatever douchebag you're having sex with (who is also clearly the person to have put you up to this, which makes sense since the type of men you sleep can probably smell low self esteem from the same distance a Bull shark can smell a blood drive).
