You walk into the gym, chest puffed out and arms out, as their size (water bloat from excessive creatine use, no doubt) is the only thing that may earn you any gympoints in the eyes of the true gym bros. You stroll over to the machine area where all the elderly and the fatties with personal trainers are instead of the Dumbbell rack, as you know you will get less stares there.
