You step to us with a piece of a ripped notebook paper While knowing you would get passed up by a drunk Don Draper Excuse my rhymes, lack of time and attention to prose I generally don't waste my Shakespeare level shit when dealing with hoes Your picture wouldn't arouse a long haul trucker high on No-Doze Or a foot fetishist that's never seen a woman's toes I'm not saying your a hooker but you've sure got the clothes But all these things are facts that you most certainly know Unless you are still sitting in the special class with a helmet in the last row Hold out hope that in those cracks of a "personality" a "relationship" may grow But please know, you'd be madder than a hatter to ever expect to get a straight males baby batter Let alone count for something that matters
