You'd be non-conforming too if you looked just like me I have paint on my nails and makeup on my face I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my legs Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in drag I call it freedom of expression, most just call me a fag 'Cause our dudes look like chicks, and our chicks look like dykes Cause emo is one step below transvestite Stop my breathing and slit my throat I must be emo I don't jump around when I go to shows I must be emo
