You look like an anorexic Amy Adams got her hair chopped up and straightened at a shitty salon, washed her mouth with bleach, applied mascara with a paint brush, picked a dress 4 sizes too big, and a slight gust of wind threw her 20 feet giving her a concussion and thinking writing ROAST ME on an avocado would be a good idea instead of FUCKING EATING IT.
