Advice: Step 1: Go to a local dermatologist Step 2: Ask for accutane (they might prescribe some bullshit that may or may not work before giving accutane) Step 2.5: if they do give you bs, try it first for a month, if it doesn't work, go back the next time you scheduled your appointment and ask for accutane Step 3: don't have acne anymore This works, trust.
