i think the problem is, with a real roast you have that person's entire life's back catalogue to go through and pick out something juicy... here - its just a photo, maybe some background and a caption... so everyone has to make assumptions to a degree... i do agree that there's too many "you suck a dick" and "you're a fag" posts, that don't even attempt to be inventive - they should be deleted, and i've deleted some of mine when i've read them back and felt they've fallen a bit flat or didn't come across the way i intended them to... PS - you are all fags and go suck a dick etc etc etc
