Here's a basic timeline of how your life is going to go- -Barely scrape past high school -Attempt University, fail, and wind up 40K in debt with nothing to show for it -Finally lose your virginity at the age of 32, just as women around you begin to lower their standards, based on their biological clocks -Get baby-trapped about 9 months into the relationship -Wake up one day at 45 and realize your entire life has been the result of someone else telling you what to do, and how to do it.
