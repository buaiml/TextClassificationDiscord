I recommend finding a nice minimum wage job ASAP though because let's face it, that $5 an hour you're making while working your street corner every night is already kind of a stretch and it's depreciating faster than you can keep track of, especially since I'm assuming your only chance to look in a mirror is if you can sneak into the local Starbucks restroom during the morning rush, which must be pretty hard now that they have your picture on the window after you stole the Mac you're currently using off one of the tables.
