You're the Private that gives your NCO endless headaches and paperwork because you spend every weekend wandering drunk (and underage) from barracks room to barracks room fucking every dude in the Brigade but then complains to the CO about how all the other soldiers in the company aren't respecting you enough, despite the fact you have a permanent profile after only 5 months in the Army and you spend every morning PT session standing around with too much makeup on trying to look pretty in a reflective belt but failing horribly, and the only reason you haven't been chaptered is that your unit is hoping you'll save them money on MWR facilities during their next deployment, which you'll probably get pregnant to avoid going on.
