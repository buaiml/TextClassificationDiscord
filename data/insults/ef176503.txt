Well I see trees of green and red roses too, I'll watch them bloom for me and you And I think to myself What a wonderful world Well I see skies of blue And I see clouds of white And the brightness of day I like the dark And I think to myself What a wonderful world The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky Are also on the faces of people passing by I see friends shaking hands Singing, "How do you do?"
