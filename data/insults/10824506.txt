I cant believe you only posted 4 pics considering you probably have thousands taken at night in black and white with your zlr in which you are half out of frame because you doint point the camera straight at yourself... one might call them geurilla selfies because "this is how i feel on the inside" Oh, and you love the movie girl interupted the same way office workers love the movie office space.
