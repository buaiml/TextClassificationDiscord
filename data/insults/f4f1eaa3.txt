You 2 are the epitome of the neighborhood sluts who show up to a party with a box of smirnoff ice, each, looking to get as drunk as possible to get enough confidence to talk to your crush and upon the inevitable "no thanks I'd rather fuck a container of rusty nails" you settle for the guy with the 1990 Nissan Pulsar hatchback and let him defile you in the back seat while you think about your crush.
