You have all of the symptoms of living in your mom's basement * Beanie and a baseball cap on at the same time * decorative buttons * women's glasses * shitty headset * Facial hair that looks like a woman's un-shaved bush * stoner face * necklace * stained shirt that's obviously been worn for at least 3 days in a row Congrats, you have no life!
