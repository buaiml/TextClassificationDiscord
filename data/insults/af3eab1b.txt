You look like that guy from SNL who talks too much and smiles even though he is not funny, thankfully you aren't on a comedy show because the ratings would be lower than your IQ which we can assume is probably below the 20th percentile, if you took AP Stats you would know that isn't even one standard deviation away from the mean, but as we have previously established your intelligence is scarce and your highest level class is probably intro to math.
