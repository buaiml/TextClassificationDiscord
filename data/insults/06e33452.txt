☑ Raised by Single Mother (can do nails, but furniture all cheap ikea shit) ☑ Near the Poverty Line (never had good orthodontics) ☑ Failing or Near-Failing in School (can't even use a composition book right) ☑ On the Pill (recently receding acne) ☑ Dumb, Loud Fashion Statements (green-yellow hair) If you dress up in black jeans and boots with some concert T-shirt, I bet you're only a $3 latte and a boring 2 hour conversation about Invader Zim away from a cream pie.
