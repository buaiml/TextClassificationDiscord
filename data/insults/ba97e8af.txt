I'm guessing by "friends", you mean the 20-50 or so boys that constantly worship your every selfie on facebook because you've either kept them around to keep your frail ego afloat, or because your life is so devoid of meaning that absorbing compliments for pictures you spend hours framing and cleaning up is one of the few things you internally consider a "hobby".
