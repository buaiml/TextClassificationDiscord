Oh shit this is too easy First off, why your ears look like a trapezoid them things straight up look like fig newtons Your smirk makes you look about as straight your hairline On god that crinkled ass forehead look like speedbumps Your whole skull looks like hey Arnold turned sideways Maybe with those ugly ass glasses you can tell me if your a dark or a light skin like damn pick a side And we all know you got that blanket so nobody can see your minecraft shirt with cargos Your face looks like something I'd catch on Thomas the tank engine I bet your the guy that asks girls, "where my hug at?"
