you look like one of those tomboys I went to school with; girls who oozed personality and joined sororities, clubs and teams because their sisters and friends were way hotter then them so they had to compensate for their masculine features but somehow were still able to make oodles of friends along the way and live relatively normal childhoods, eventually growing up and going to college, earning advanced degrees and begin to see the fruits of DECADES OF STRUGGLING only to find out they have incurable cancer and have less then a year to live.
