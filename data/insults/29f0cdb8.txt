So successful behind your $34 particle board desk, typing on your bullshit Dell that still runs Windows XP, sipping your store brand coffee that you brewed through your base model Keurig, that pepto bismol gets chugged on the daily as your stomach is forming ulcer after ulcer because you can't handle the stress of sucking so god damn much in your wrinkled to shit shirt which is only part of your TJ Maxx work ensemble that you bought right after you got that Super Cuts bullshit haircut.
