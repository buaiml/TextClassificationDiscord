Just guessing here, but you're actually a 13 year old middle school student living in a decent neighborhood in Maryland, whose used car salesman father drives a Nissan pickup and claims that it "is too a real truck" when your wino mother with badly implanted fake tits that she got on her 40th birthday after a midlife crisis cries herself to sleep because the only reason she is still in her failing marriage is because her fat, world of Warcraft addicted son who changes his persona every semester of school back and forth from white gangster wannabe to annoying fake redneck?
