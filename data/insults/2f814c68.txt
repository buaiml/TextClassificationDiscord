Between your child like printing, the glazed over "my bloodstream is 65% superglue" expression, your 4 for $5 hanes t-shirt, your bad 35 year old father of three combover, and the background decor of "we spent $50 to make people think they're not in a padded room with a giant firehose outside the front door", I am absolutely convinced you're one of those savant retards who made a wi fi computer out of a meal tray and shoelaces, but otherwise have the satisfied look of someone who sits in his own feces all day long and then licks it from his fingers.
