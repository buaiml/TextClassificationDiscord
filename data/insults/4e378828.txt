Based on all that I'd wager you habor a deep distrust of anyone with a darker skin-tone than your cubical wall, fear more than anything the prospect of being replaced by either an automated system or a 5-cent and hour call center in Pakistan, and you likely only trust news sources that reinforce your current world view or foster a spirit of paranoia because you can't stand the idea of being wrong about one more thing in your life, after every other decision you've made has turned to absolute shit.
