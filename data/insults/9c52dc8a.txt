I could be cruel and make fun of your greasy hair, your pre-manhater permanent scowl or your fat fingers that look like they've been pulled from a 60 year old child-molester but that would be a waste considering the way you put yourself down when you pass a guy you've liked for moths and do nothing about it because you know he wouldn't fuck you drunk or for money or when your mother calls you fat [again] because let's face it, theres nothing I could say to you that your crusty tear-drenched pillow hasn't heard you say to yourself.
