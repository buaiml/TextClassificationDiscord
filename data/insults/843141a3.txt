Are you aware that Nazism was a nationalistic movement, and you're clearly not German (Germans are sharply dressed) and also, even if it's just the antisemetic-sympathy that gets you going, are you aware that Nazis weren't exactly fans of non-white queers, either?\ But I know that doesn't matter, and you just like to be part of something "edgy" to feel special and superior.
