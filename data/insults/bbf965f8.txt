You can't do anything about your physique (which resembles that of an underage Thai hooker), you can't do anything about your face (which has the appearance of boiled meat), and you can't do anything about your teeth (without extensive and expensive cosmetic work that's obviously way out of your reach), but you CAN do something about your hair, and yet you have chosen not to.
