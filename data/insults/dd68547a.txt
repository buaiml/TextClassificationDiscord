Please tell me you did not think about getting green hair, go to the store, find the box, pull out money saved from your burger flipping job over the course of 6 months, purchase that dye, have your captain underbite ass friend help you dye that shit, and at no point thought "This is a dumb idea, I'm 24 years old" Close your legs, I don't need to know if the carpet matches the drapes
