Let's see here... Lightly modified Subaru: ☑ Hairstyle that is carefully worked just so to not look worked on: ☑ Two watches, as a no-doubt ironic 'signature look': ☑ One of them is a Rolex: ☑ It just happens to be the one we can see: ☑ Deliberately casual pose: ☑ Hard-to-get Icelandic beer: ☑ Sockless: ☑ Sunglasses right out of the Talented Mr. Ripley: ☑ Poor choices in facial hair: ☑ I'm guessing you're either gay, still in the closet, and just begging for someone to find out, or you're not and you're pretending to be in hopes that grandpa writes you out of the will.
