You look loud, like someone who tries to fill the silence so that nobody gets a chance to sit back and actually think about why they're spending time around you because you've learned that once you allow them to do that they very quickly drift away from you, leaving you treading water alone in an ocean of loneliness with the murky shadows of self doubt nibbling at your floundering feet :) Good luck with the youtubes :D
