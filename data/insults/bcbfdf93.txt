Whatever sex toy you're holding distracts me from saying something about the Sun In your hair, which distracts me from saying something about your flesh colored glasses, which distracts me from scolding you for not doing something about your shoulder hair, which distracts me from saying something about your not tiny body type in that sleeveless shirt that distracts me from talking about your masturbation blanket that distracts me from calling you a slob.
