You look like you're the type of girl who goes to her boyfriend's ~~house~~ mom's house to hang out in his room for a couple hours, but he totally ignores you while he's working on his "OMG BLINDFOLD 360 NO SCOPE LOL", so then you drive home, feeling dejected with tears streaming down your face, ruining your mascara--making your face look like a Jackson Pollack painting, singing "Royals" at the top of your lungs.
